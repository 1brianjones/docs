At this time, there is no comprehensive authoring environment for Argon. As a result the best way to test and debug Argon experiences is by running the code in the standard browsers (Safari or Chrome), either on a laptop or on a mobile device connected to a laptop. While more testing is possible using a Mac running OS X, you can also do some testing on a Windows machine. 

### Preliminary debugging of html, css, or javascript

Any html and css that you have in your experience can of course be developed and tested using any web editor/environment that you prefer prior to inserting the code into the Argon experience. The same is true of any javascript/Typescript code that does not call use Argon methods or objects.

### Test an Argon channel on a desktop or laptop browser

Using Safari or Chrome browser


### Test an Argon channel on an iPhone or iPad in the Safari browser connected to a laptop or desktop

Much of the functionality of the experience can be tested and debugging by connecting the Safari browser on your iPhone/iPad and to Safari browser

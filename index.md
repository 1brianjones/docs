The *argon.js* framework is designed to make it easy to build AR-enabled web-applications that will run in any standard web-browser. Apps built with *argon.js* are normal web-apps, built with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, WebGL, etc), which can be hosted with any standard server-side architecture. No proprietary server-side solution required! While argon.js apps will run in any standard web browser, we also envision a future in which browsers have additional AR-inspired capabiltiies. We are exploring these ideas within the [Argon Browser](http://argonjs.io/argon-app/) (which already allows multiple apps to run and be visible at the same time, for example), and these use-cases have informed the design of *argon.js*.

This site contains a collection of articles for learning how to use *argon.js* to add Augmented Reality content to a web application. 

* For an introduction to the terminology and concepts used by the framework, please read the [overview](/concepts/overview/).
* For a guided walkthrough demonstrating how to build a simple *argon.js* app from start to finish, leveraging the [three.js](threejs.org) rendering library, check out the [tutorial](/tutorial/).
* If you would like to contribute to *argon.js* (or just peer at the source), the *argon.js* framework is available on [Github](https://github.com/argonjs/argon).
* Apps built with *argon.js* will run in any standard web browser. However, the [Argon Browser](http://argonjs.io/argon-app) supports additional AR capabilties that can be leveraged by *argon.js* apps.
